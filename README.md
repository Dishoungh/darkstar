# Introduction
This will be a large project that will contain multiple subprojects. The reason I named this repo "darkstar" is because whenever I get close to creating something, I aim to name it Darkstar. Why? I just think it's a cool name.

At the time of making this edit (6/14/23), I literally know nothing about designing CPUs, schematics, PCBs, etc. But I want to learn and I'm using this to document my progress and as a time capsule for when I eventually become good at this.

My goal is to someday design schematics, PCB layouts, and solder on components for a custom board [like this](https://github.com/petit-miner/Blueberry-PI). I would like to do that someday. It frustrates me everyday that I have yet to learn these skills. I won't document every single little thing I do but I'll try to package as neatly and chronologically as possible of what I learn so not only I can use this as a reference for future designs and for someone else who is similar to me.

# Part 1: Designing a Custom CPU (Logisim)

Designing a custom RISC-V 64-bit CPU. Refer to my [CPU Repository](https://github.com/Dishoungh/cpu.git) for more information.

# Part 2: TBD
