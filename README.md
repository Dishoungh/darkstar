# Introduction
This will be a large project that will contain multiple subprojects. The reason I named this repo "darkstar" is because whenever I get close to creating something, I aim to name it Darkstar. Why? I just think it's a cool name.

At the time of making this edit (11/5/23), I literally know NOTHING. But I want to learn and I'm using this to document my progress and as a time capsule for when I eventually become good at this.

My goal is to someday design schematics, PCB layouts, and solder on components for a custom board [like this](https://github.com/petit-miner/Blueberry-PI). I would like to do that someday. It frustrates me everyday that I have yet to learn these skills. I won't document every single little thing I do but I'll try to package as neatly and chronologically as possible of what I learn so not only I can use this as a reference for future designs, but also someone else who is in a similar position as me can take this and make their own designs.

# Tools Used
- [Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)
    - This is an FPGA development package that allows us to simulate HDL and synthesize, implement, and create bitstreams for FPGAs.
    - *Add more details; I'm not done with Logisim yet :(*
- [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/)
    - This is a cross platform and open source Electronics Design Automation (EDA) tool that allows us to create schematics and PCB layouts.
    - *Add more details; I'm not done with Logisim yet :(*
