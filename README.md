# Overview
This will pretty much be a documentation repository. Just some background, I'm a Computer Engineer trained in mostly software engineering. I've learned a bit of electrical/electronics engineering for one semester's worth of courses but that's it. I'm pretty basic and I aim on addressing that and honing my hardware engineering skills.

My goal is to someday design schematics, PCB layouts, and solder on components for a custom board [like this](https://github.com/petit-miner/Blueberry-PI). I would like to do that someday. It frustrates me everyday that I have yet to learn this early on. I won't document every single little thing I do but I'll try to package as neatly and chronologically as possible of what I learn so not only I can use this as a reference for future designs and for someone else who is similar to me.

This is for you if you have a pretty solid background in software design but a weak background in hardware.
